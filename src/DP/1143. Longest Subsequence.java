/*
Given two strings text1 and text2, return the length of their longest common subsequence. If there is no common subsequence, return 0.
A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

For example, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde".
A common subsequence of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.
Example 1:

Input: text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace" 
Output: 3  
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "ace" and its length is 3.
Example 2:

Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "abc"
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "abc" and its length is 3.
Example 3:

Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "def"
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no such common subsequence, so the result is 0.

// Methodology:
// Use 2D array to check each possible char accordingly.

class Solution {
    public int longestCommonSubsequence(String text1, String text2) {    
        // If text1 doesn't reference the shortest string, swap them.
        if (text2.length() < text1.length()) {
            String temp = text1;
            text1 = text2;
            text2 = temp;
        }
        
        // The previous and current column starts with all 0's and like 
        // before is 1 more than the length of the first word.
        int[] previous = new int[text1.length() + 1];
        int[] current = new int[text1.length() + 1];
        
        // Iterate through each column, starting from the last one.
        for (int col = text2.length() - 1; col >= 0; col--) {
            for (int row = text1.length() - 1; row >= 0; row--) {
                if (text1.charAt(row) == text2.charAt(col)) {
                    current[row] = 1 + previous[row + 1];
                } else {
                    current[row] = Math.max(previous[row], current[row + 1]);
                }
            }
            // The current column becomes the previous one, and vice versa.
            int[] temp = previous;
            previous = current;
            current = temp;
        }
        
    // The original problem's answer is in previous[0]. Return it.
    return previous[0];
